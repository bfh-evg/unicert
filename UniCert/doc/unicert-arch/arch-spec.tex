\chapter{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This document presents the architectural specification of \unicert. \unicert\ is a certification authority, that issues digital certificates used to authenticate users, to sign and/or encrypt messages. \unicert\ provides an interface where the user can authenticate themselves and request predefined parameters that must appear in the certificate they will ask \unicert\ to issue. \unicert\ uses \uniboard\ to publish all issued certificates. A general description of what \unicert\ does and how it works is available in document \cite{univote_spec}. 

This document presents the detailed certificate issuing process and focuses on architectural and technical specifications. In a \Cref{chap:process}, the components and processes of authentication and issuance of the certificate will be described in more details. \Cref{chap:architecture} describes the architecture of some important classes. Finally, \Cref{chap:specialities} describes some important \unicert\ particularities.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Components and Processes} \label{chap:process}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To give an overview of how \unicert\ works, we give a high-level picture of the architecture and the processes that compose \unicert.

\section{Components}

\unicert\ is composed of two components. The first one, the authentication component called \textit{unicert-authentication}, has following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item authenticate the user
%\item allow the user to get predefined parameters that must appear in a certificate
\item received certificate request data and send them to issuer component
\item return the issued certificate (received from the issuer component) to the user.
\end{itemize}
The application using \unicert\ is responsible for generating the key pair and choosing other values to certify. \unicert\ provides only a test user interface for these tasks.

The second component, the issuer component called \textit{unicert-issuer}, has following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item issue the certificate based on the data received
\item post the certificate on \uniboard
\item return the certificate to the authentication component
\end{itemize}

\section{Authentication Process} \label{sec:auth_process}


Currently, the authentication component supports two identity providers to authenticate the user, namely SwitchAAI and Google. Even they do not use the same technologies, the flow of the authentication process is similar. Their concrete implementation differ however slightly. The authentication process shows in \Cref{fig:auth_process} is described below.

To begin the procedure, the user asks the application using \unicert\ to authenticate themselves. The application calls the \textit{AuthenticationServlet} of \textit{unicert-authentication} providing the identifier of the identity provider, the return url that will by called by \textit{unicert-authentication} at the end of the authentication process to go back to the application and optionally an additional parameter. \textit{AuthenticationServlet} saves the return url and the additional parameter in the session and makes a redirect on selected identity provider's authentication page where the user can process to the login. If the login process is successful, the identity provider returns user attributes to \textit{SwitchAAICallbackServlet} (in case of SwitchAAI) or \textit{OAuth2CallbackServlet} (in case of Google). Theses servlets save the user attributes in the session and call the \textit{CallbackServlet}. This servlet call the return url saved in the session, though some information back to the application (session id, e-mail of user, unique id of user, and the additional parameter passed when requesting the authentication page).

At the end of the authentication process, the application has an authenticated session on \textit{unicert-authentication} for this user.

%\paragraph*{SwitchAAI authentication} SwitchAAI uses a Shibboleth module of Apache webserver to make the redirection to the authentication webpage and back. \Cref{fig:auth_process_switch} shows how the process works. To begin the procedure, the user must invoke a link containing some information about what parameters must be loaded for the authentication and issuance process (described in more details later in \Cref{sec:simplification_ui}). This can for example be done by clicking on a link on the home page of \unicert. This link calls the \textit{ParameterServlet} which loads the required parameters, among others the supported identity providers for authentication. If more than one are supported, page \textit{idpselection.xhtml} is displayed where the user can choose which provider to use.

%For the present case, SwitchAAI is selected. Page \textit{switchaai.xhtml} is requested. For this page, the Apache Shibboleth module expects a valid user to be logged in. If it is not the case, the user is redirected to SwitchAAI authentication page. Once the credentials entered and the user successfully authenticated by SwitchAAI, the Apache Shibboleth module verifies the response received from Switch and displays the \textit{switchaai.xhtml} page where the user personal information received from Switch are read. After a few seconds, the user is redirected to the page where the certificate can be requested (\textit{certificate-request.xhtml}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/authentication_process}}
\caption{Authentication process}
\label{fig:auth_process}
\end{figure}

%\paragraph*{Google authentication} Google uses protocol OAuth to manage the authentication. Because of this different technology, the process of authentication with Google is slightly different from the one with SwitchAAI. \Cref{fig:auth_process_google} shows how it works. The first steps are identical until the identity provider is chosen (for this case Google). The \textit{ParametersServlet} redirects the user to Google where the authentication process takes place. The response from Google is sent back to the \textit{OAuth2CallbackServlet} which verifies the response from Google and reads the user personal information received. If everything was correct, the user is redirected to the page where the certificate can be requested (\textit{certificate-request.xhtml}).

%\centerline{
%\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/authentication_process_google}}
%\caption{Authentication process with Google OAuth}
%\label{fig:auth_process_google}
%\end{figure}

%\section{Parameters Request}\label{sec:param_request}
%
%Once the user authenticated, the application can propose them to generate the key pair and indicate some parameters that must appear in the certificate. Since, most of the time however, these parameters are the same for a lot of users, \unicert\ allows to predefine parameter sets containing these parameters, so that the user must not define them themselves.
%
%These parameters can be retrieved form the \textit{ParametersServlet}. Therefore, the application must provide the session id received at then end of the authentication process, since these parameters are stored in the user session. The application can then fill the user interface with these parameters in order to simplify the certificate request for the user. More details about these parameters sets can be found in \Cref{sec:simplification_ui}.

\section{Certificate Issuance Process} \label{sec:issuance_process}

The rest of the process is issuance of the certificate. This works in the same way independently of the identity provider used. The process is shown in \Cref{fig:request_process}. The application using \unicert\ must provide following information to request a certificate: 
\begin{itemize}
\item type of cryptographic values (currently supported: RSA and discrete logarithm)
\item cryptographic parameters: size of key for RSA, values $p,q,g$ for discrete logarithm
\item a private key (generated locally and not sent to the server)
\item a public key corresponding to the private key
\item a password to encrypt the private key (not send to the server)
\item application identifier of the application which the certificate is issued for
\item role in the application the certificate is issued for
\item the identity function that must be applied on the identity information
\item a cryptographic proof or signature demonstrating knowledge of the private key
\end{itemize}

The generation of the private key is responsibility of the application or the user. The public key corresponding to the generated private key must be computed together with a signature (or a proof in case of discrete logarithm setup) to prove the knowledge of the private key. The data listed above (except the private key and the password) must then be sent to the \textit{CertificateRequestServlet}. In this servlet, the user's personal information (also called \textit{user data}) that were received during the authentication process (see \Cref{sec:auth_process}) are used in combination with the provided identity function to generate the \textit{identity data} that will be included in the certificate. This process is realized by the \textit{unicert-authentication} component. The data received and the identity data are then transmitted to the \textit{unicert-issuer} component. This second component verifies the data received and issues the certificate as requested, publishes it on \uniboard and returns it to the \textit{unicert-authentication} component which sends it back to the application.

\chapter{Architecture and Interface} \label{chap:architecture}
This chapter describes the interface of \textit{unicert-authentication} and provide explanations on some classes and the architecture concepts of both \textit{unicert-authentication} and \textit{unicert-issuer} components.

\section{unicert-authentication}

\textit{unicert-authentication} is a web application, but all the tasks are done in the Java part in servlets, namely the \textit{AuthenticationServlet}, \textit{CertificateRequestServlet} and \textit{CallbackServlet}. Some important concepts related to the data that must be sent to \unicert\ to request a certificate will be described here.

\subsection{Interface}

This subsection describes the data that must be sent to \textit{unicert-authentication} for the authentication phase and the certificate request phase.

\paragraph*{Authentication process}

For the authentication request, information displayed in \Cref{t:authreq} must be sent as HTTP GET parameters. \Cref{t:authresp} shows the information returned in the url after successful authentication.

  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Information sent after successful authentication}
\label{t:authresp}
\end{table}

\paragraph*{Certificate request}

For the certificate request, some information must be provided. For a RSA certificate, information displayed in \Cref{t:rsa} must be sent, for a discrete logarithm certificate \Cref{t:dlog} shows them. This time, these parameters must be sent as HTTP POST parameters.

\begin{table}[ht]

Each identity function is identified by a number. \Cref{t:idfunc} shows which id correspond to which function.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
  \hline
  Id & Identity function\\
  \hline
  1 & Standard SwitchAAI identity function\\
  2 & Anonymized SwitchAAI identity function\\
  3 & SwitchAAI identity function for University of Zürich\\
  4 & Standard Google identity function\\
  5 & Anonymized Google identity function\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Index of identity functions}
\label{t:idfunc}
\end{table}

The message of the signature that must be submitted with the RSA certificate request is in fact the concatenation of the other parameter sent. Besides proving the knowledge of the private key corresponding to the public key sent, this signature allows the server to verify that the parameters received have not been modified by someone during the request. The same feature is obtained in the discrete logarithm case by pushing the same message in the hash function used during challenge generation. This messages is structured as follows (separator between values is a pipe "|"):

\textit{idp|user\_email|user\_unique\_id|crypto\_setup\_type|crypto\_setup\_size|public\_key|\\rsa\_modulo|identity\_function|application\_identifier|role}

for RSA and

\textit{idp|user\_email|user\_unique\_id|crypto\_setup\_type|crypto\_setup\_size|public\_key|\\dlog\_p|dlog\_q|dlog\_generator|identity\_function|application\_identifier|role}

for discrete logarithm.




\subsection{UserData and IdentityFunction}

The format of the user data returned by the identity provider is not the same for all identity providers. The way these data are transmitted to \unicert\ is also different for various identity providers. These facts require a flexible solution to provide support of multiple identity providers and to allow to easily add a new identity provider.

SwitchAAI use a Shibboleth Apache module for the authentication. This technology requires a user to be logged in before displaying a web page or accessing a servlet. In this concrete case, it is the page \textit{AuthenticationServlet}. If the user is not logged in when calling the address of this servlet, a redirection takes place to SwitchAAI login page. After a successful login, the servlet \textit{SwitchAAICallbackServlet} is called, where the user's identity are read. These user data are then stored in the session in an object of the class \textit{SwitchAAIUserData}.

For Google, the user data are returned to a servlet called \textit{OAuth2CallbackServlet} after successful login. This servlet stores the user data in a object of the class \textit{GoogleUserData} in the session. Both \textit{SwitchAAIUserData} and \textit{GoogleUserData} inherits from the \textit{UserData} interface but their content is not the same as shown in \Cref{fig:userdata}, .

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/userdata_class_diagram.png}}
\caption{Class diagram of user data classes}
\label{fig:userdata}
\end{figure}

The \textit{certificate-issuer} component, however, must know the content and structure of the UserData object in order to be able to extract the data needed in the certificate. Therefore, an identity function is used. There is at least one identity function per identity provider that knows the format of the corresponding user data. So, the GoogleIdentityFunction class knows the fields present in a GoogleUserData object, and the SwitchAAIIdentityFunction knows the content of the SwitchAAIUserData. These IdentityFunction objects allows to transform a concrete UserData object into a generic class called \textit{IdentityData} containing the identity information needed for the certificate. This IdentityData object can then be used by the \textit{certificate-issuer} component.

The way how the identity information are extracted from a concrete UserData object is defined in a concrete IdentityFunction object. This process must be adaptable: for example an application could require the e-mail address to appear in certificate, another application could require an other unique identifier, or a third application could require an anonymized form of the e-mail address, and so on. Therefore, multiple IdentityFunction can exist for the same identity provider. In this implementation, there is a standard and an anonymized identity function for each identity provider (\textit{StandardSwitchAAIIdentityFunction}, \textit{StandardGoogleIdentityFunction}, \textit{AnonymizedSwitchAAIIdentityFunction}, \textit{AnonymizedGoogleIdentityFunction}). For SwitchAAI, there is a third variant specially designed for the university of Zürich which uses the student identification number as common name (\textit{ZurichSwitchAAIIdentityFunction}).

The organisation of these classes is shown in \Cref{fig:identity_function_class_diagram}. The \textit{apply} method is the publicly available method extracting the information out of the given UserData object and returning the generated IdentityData object shown in \Cref{fig:identity_data}. Different protected methods are used for this process. \textit{selectCommonName} is responsible for extracting the common name from the UserData. In standard functions, the e-mail address is used. In anonymized function, a hash of the e-mail address is used. In the special function for Zürich, the student identification number is used. \textit{selectUniqueId} is responsible for extracting a unique identifier from the UserData. \textit{putInOtherValues} allows to add information in extensions of the certificate in case it cannot be included in the fields proposed in the IdentityData class. Finally, method \textit{createIdentityData} indicate which fields are put in the IdentityData object. This architecture allows to create subclasses which can overwrite some behavior of the super class. For example, method \textit{createIdentityData} in anonymized function does not include ''firstname'' and ''surname'' in the IdentityData object as this is done in standard functions.

\subsection{Error description}

Errors occurring during the issuance process should be communicated in an understandable way to the user. Therefore, error codes have been introduced. When an error occurs, an HTTP 500 response is sent with a JSON content containing an error code and a default error description. The error codes are listed in \Cref{t:errorCodes1} and \Cref{t:errorCodes2}.

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|}
  \hline
  Code & Name & Description\\

  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Errors originating from \textit{unicert-issuer}}
\label{t:errorCodes2}
\end{table}

\section{unicert-issuer}

\textit{unicert-issuer} is an EJB component responsible for the issuance of the certificate. The main class is the \textit{CertificateIssuer} EJB which checks the data received and issues the certificate. Some other classes used in this process will be described in this section.

\subsection{CryptographicSetup}

The class \textit{CryptographicSetup} is a container for all cryptographic values that are submitted by the user and that must be included in the certificate or verified in the \textit{unicert-issuer} component. Two concrete CryptographicSetup exist: \textit{DiscreteLogSetup} and \textit{RSASetup} as shown in \Cref{fig:cryptographic_setup_class_diagram}. They both include all values that define such a setup and the signature or proof generated in the frontend. Objects of these classes are created by the \textit{unicert-authentication} component on certificate request.

\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/cryptographic_setup_class_diagram.png}}
\caption{Class diagram of the cryptographic setup classes}
\label{fig:cryptographic_setup_class_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Certificate class}

Certificate class is the Java representation of the X.509 certificate that is issued. The fields that appear in that certificate are stored here together with the PEM format of the issued certificate as shown in \Cref{fig:certificate}. When posting the certificate on \uniboard, a JSON representation of this class is created through the method \textit{toJSON}. This allows \uniboard\ to make query on the content of a certificate. The listing below shows the schema of the generated JSON certificate.

\chapter{UniCert Particularities} \label{chap:specialities}
This chapter describes in more details some particularities of \unicert.

\section{X.509 Certificate Extensions}

Some special information must be added by \unicert\ in the issued certificate, like the identity provider used for the authentication, the application and the role the certificate is issued for. This information cannot really be included in existing X.509 fields. So, we defined some extensions for each of these elements. In X.509 certificates, an extension must always be identified by an object identifier (OID). The Bern University of Applied Sciences own a group OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.13305. Following subgroup is reserved for \unicert\: 1.3.6.1.4.1.13305.1.101.x. \Cref{t:oids} presents the elements included in the certificate and their corresponding OIDs. The content of these extensions are always ASN1 strings.

\section{JNDI Propreties for \textit{unicert-issuer}}

To work properly, \textit{unicert-issuer} require some configuration values. These values are defined as JNDI properties. \Cref{t:jndi1} shows what are these values. They are stored in a property set called \textit{unicertProps}.

\begin{table}[ht]

\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  Property & Description\\
  \hline
  keystoreExternal & If the keystore must be loaded from an external location\\
  keystorePath & Path to the keystore containing the certificate and private key\\ &  of \unicert\ for signing issued certificates\\
  keystorePass & Password for the keystore \\
  privateKeyPass & Password used to protect private key of \unicert\ certificate \\
  issuerId & Name of the issuer of the generated certificates and id of the key in the keystore \\
  validityYears & Time slot in which the certificate is valid (2 years) \\
  uniboardURL & URL of \uniboard\ webservice (if not indicated, certificates are\\ & not published)\\
  uniboardSection & Section where to publish on \uniboard\\
  boardId & Id of the public key of the board in the keystore \\
  googleRedirectURI & URL of the callback servlet after Google OAuth2 authentication \\
  googleClientID & OAuth2 credentials for Google authentication\\
  googleClientSecret & OAuth2 credentials for Google authentication\\

%\section{Simplification of the User Interface}\label{sec:simplification_ui}
%
%As described in \Cref{sec:issuance_process}, when the user requests a certificate, they have to provide, among other, following information:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item type of cryptographic values (currently supported: RSA and discrete logarithm)
%\item cryptographic parameters: size of key for RSA, values $p,q,g$ for discrete logarithm
%\item application identifier of the application the certificate is issued for
%\item role in the application the certificate is issued for
%\item the identity function that must be applied on the user's personal information
%\end{itemize}
%
%Most of the time however, these values are the same for a lot of users. For example, when a voter wants to issue a voter certificate for \univote, the cryptographic values, the application identifier (in this case \univote) and the role (in this case \textit{Voter}) are the same for all users that request a certificate. Even the identity function is the same for all voters inside a given election. So, it is unintuitive to ask each user to enter all these data. Therefore, a feature has been implemented allowing to preset all these values. It works with JNDI properties. The administrator can define multiple JNDI property sets giving them a name like ''/unicert/mypropertyset''. In this property set, the administrator can define the properties they want not to be filled by the user. The ones that are not defined must then be filled by the user in the certificate request process. The property set is loaded by the \textit{ParametersServlet} which receives the name of the property set to load through the link on which the user has clicked to start the authentication process, for example ''authenticate?params=mypropertyset''. If no property set is indicated, a default property set is loaded containing only the identity providers supported. All others information must be filled by the user. \Cref{t:jndi2} shows the JNDI properties that can be preset in a property set.
